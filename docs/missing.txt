                What's missing compared to previous versions?

- Registration dialogs, key checking, restrictions of unregistered version.

- Some unfinished parts that were never included in a released version.

- Documentation about the registration procedure

- Support for IMail 1.85 and later. Andreas Klein denied permission to
  include the structure definitions.

- Support for GEcho. Gerard van der Land did not respond to my messages.
