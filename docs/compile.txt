                           How to compile the source

What you need:

IBM VAC++ 3.0 with OS/2 Toolkit
Squish MsgAPI Toolkit
Rexx
HPFS
Info-ZIP (when making binary distributions)

How to compile:

1. Edit MAKEFILE

The macro MSGAPIDIR must point to the directory where the Squish MsgAPI Toolkit
is located on your machine. Otherwise the source is completely position
independent.

2. Edit PMSTDDLG.H

Change the line

   #define CCS_MINIRECORDCORE        0x00000040L

to

   #define CCS_MINIRECORDCORE        0x00000840L


This change is necessary to have containes in tree view with mini icons. The
change must be in the OS/2 standard header, because the above macro is used
by the dialog editor, and you can't force it to add some other flag or use
a different header file.

3. Edit MSGAPI.H

Change all function pointer declarations from e.g.

    void   * (MAPIENTRY * palloc)(size_t size);

to

    void   * (* MAPIENTRY palloc)(size_t size);

Only the latter form is accepted by CSet++/VAC++.

4. Run nmake

Run nmake from the source directory. The compilation process should run to
the end. This takes 6 1/2 minutes on my machine.

5. Run program

All binary files are located in .\bin. Change to this directory and run
the program.

6. Cleanup

A complete cleanup procedure can be started with

nmake clean

from the source directory. This deletes all binary files and intermediate
files. INI files in the .\bin directory are not deleted, so after rebuilding
FleetStreet you can run it with the settings retained from a previous version.

7. Make binary distributions

To make a binary distribution (ZIP file containing installation program)
run

nmake binary

from the source directory. The file FLEET.ZIP is generated in the current
directory.
