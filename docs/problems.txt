                        FleetStreet known problems etc.
                        ===============================

This file is in no way complete. I rather fix known problems than documenting
them :-)

1. Question: When FleetStreet is minimized and I click on the program object
             to restore it, nothing happens.
   Answer: This is a problem due to how OS/2 manages the window list. When
           sub-windows of FleetStreet are open, they are inserted into the
           window list. However, the system adds the new entries _before_
           the main window. So when you double click on the program object,
           the system tries to restore one of the sub-windows instead of the
           main window. This fails because all sub-windows are hidden at that
           moment.
   Solution: I don't know a solution at this time, it's being investigated.
   Workaround: Use the window list itself.

2. Q: Squish 1.1x (SQ386P) doesn't run correctly when started from a Rexx
      script. It fails to start the archiver.
   A: This may be a bug in Squish 1.1x. It's being investigated.
   S: none
   W: Don't start Squish 1.1x from within FleetStreet or use the START
      command to let Squish run in a separate session.

3. Q: When FleetStreet and Squish run in parallel and messages are tossed
      to the current area, FleetStreet doesn't update its display.
   A: FleetStreet doesn't have a chance to recognize that something has
      changed in the message area. The MsgAPI isn't _really_ "multitasking
      aware", processes that update a message area simultanously may even
      destroy the index file of the area! This is _not_ a FleetStreet bug!
   S: None
   W: Close FleetStreet while Squish is tossing messages.

4. Q: I sometimes don't get the correct help panel when I press F1.
   A: This may happen when a spin button in a notebook has the focus. OS/2
      Warp Beta II and 3.0 have a bug that prevents FleetStreet to show
      the correct help panel. It also happens with drop-down lists.
      This is an official APAR, PJ17235 and PJ17293
   S: Install Warp FixPack #6 or newer.

5. Q: FleetStreet crashes when accessing the message base via TCP/IP 2.0 NFS.
   A: The MSGAPI32.DLL and NFS of TCP/IP 2.0 don't like each other. This is
      because NFS doesn't support record locking.
   S: none.
   W: Other network systems (e.g. Lan Server, OS/2 Peer, Client Connect) don't
      have that problem.

6. Q: After using Drag-Drop, icons or bitmaps are sometimes corrupted, e.g.
      the buttons of the toolbar.
   A: This is a bug of OS/2 Warp 3.0. It's APAR number is PJ17913.
   S: none, IBM needs to fix this
   W: Either use OS/2 2.x or get used to it until it's fixed in OS/2 3.x

7. Q: I can't select pages of text in the editor (SHIFT-PgDown etc.)
   A: The MLE control doesn't support such a function.
   S: None, IBM must implement this.
   W: None. Ask IBM to do something about their MLE control.

8. Q: I need more than one level of "Undo" in the editor.
   A: Again, the MLE control allows only one level.
   S: None, IBM must implement this.
   W: None. Ask IBM to do something about their MLE control.

9. Q: Squish doesn't use some message attributes like "direct" or "hub route".
   A: These nonstandard attributes are not handled by Squish. Other tosser
      programs like Fastecho do handle them.

10. Q: The nodelist lookup doesn't find some entries
    A: This function doesn't work correctly when FeelX is running.
    S: Close FeelX.

11. Q: When replying to an Echomail message by Netmail and selecting to reply
       to TO, the wrong destination address is used for the Netmail message.
    A: Fidonet Echomail doesn't contain the recipient's address, simply because
       there is no single recipient. The address field is usually filled with
       the downlink's address (depending on the tosser). Consequently,
       FleetStreet can't insert the correct address automatically.
    S: Insert the correct address manually.

12. Q: The area list scrolls to the top when switching to it.
    A: This is a bug introduced with Fixpack #17. It's still present in Merlin.
       It's not FleetStreet's fault.
    S: Uninstall FP #17 or install Warp 4.0 FP #1.

13. Q: The thread list isn't drawn correctly sometimes.
    A: This is a known problem. I don't know what's causing it.
    S: none, at this time.

14. Q: FleetStreet doesn't save its settings when shutting down the OS using
       the WarpCenter.
    S: Use the shutdown function in the desktop's context menu.

15. Q: I can't select a print border. FleetStreet always prints with border 0.
    A: This is a problem of the spin button control in Warp fixpacks 10 and up.
    S: None, IBM must fix this.
    W: The current version switches to a default value of 1 cm when it fails
       to query the actual value from the spin buttons in the setup dialog.
